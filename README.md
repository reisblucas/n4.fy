  <summary><strong>Project story:</strong></summary>

  In the beginning of the project, I want to make a Spotify clone and the required project was to make only some functionalities like favorite/unfavorite, with some restrictions about apresentation to the client, consume data from api and show in the page using React Life-Cycle.
  So talking about the aesthetic side, it's a free choice and I want to go beyond and recreate the same design and functionalities of the Spotify app with Friends Activity and Player.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Goals:</strong></summary>

  - [X] [20/20] - Remove the max of code smells until date 05/18. (Fullfilled 05/19)

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Skills:</strong></summary>

  &nbsp; - Make requisitions and consume data provided by iTunes API;\
  &nbsp; - Use React Component Life-Cycle;\
  &nbsp; - Control states;\
  &nbsp; - Use route control with BrowserRouter;\
  &nbsp; - Create routes and map the correct path;\
  &nbsp; - Make persistent components to be showed in screen with Switch;\
  &nbsp; - React-Redux to store in global storage;\
  &nbsp; - Integration between app without Redux and implement Redux.

</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Challenges:</strong></summary>

  &nbsp; - Make persistent components in Desktop, optimize for Mobile and Tablet Screens;\
  &nbsp; - Begin integration with Redux, because when I started the project I hadn't the knowledge about Redux or Context API;\
  &nbsp; - UI Alignment in Album filters with listed songs in Album and Favorite routes, because they use the same component;\
  &nbsp; - Progress bar/volume bar, very difficult and it's not 100% optmized(CSS Optimization for Chrome only);\
  &nbsp; - Remove keyboard from screen;\
  &nbsp; - I didn't found a way to make a function to Zoom Out after trigger Input in mobile screens, so I used minimum requirements for some Browsers to not trigger;\
  &nbsp; - CORS errors and was the last thing I solved.
